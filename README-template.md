## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

This one was reasonably straight forward, although I did manage to learn how to create the shadow effect using the position absolute and relative. I also learned how to stop the button/anchor tag from taking up the full width of the card when it was flexed by adding the class w-fit. Simple things but always good to keep expanding my knowledge of tailwind CSS

### Continued development

There seems to be an everlasting amount of ways to style my html and i will continue to learn as much about Tailwind CSS as i can before moving onto the more complex javascript.

### Useful resources

https://convertacolor.com/ I found this handy for converting the colour from HSL to HEX which seems to work better with Tailwind

I also used Pixel Perfect pro extension on my browser to help me get the finished card as close to the original as possible.
